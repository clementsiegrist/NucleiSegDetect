Nuclei detection and counting as well as the retrieval of their characteristics. This represent a full process from detecting and segmentating the spots to counting them with the help of various preprocessing algorithms.

## Outline

**I. Segmentation with Deep Learning**

**II. Post Processing with thresholding, erosion and dilation**

**III. Post Processing by adding Blob Detectors and Active Contours to the previous algorithms**

**IV. Conclusion**
